# blazor-ui-composition-sample

Sample applications to showcase different UI composition approaches.  These are not intended to by micro-frontends, but to attempt to keep as much business UI rendering and state logic within the business boundary without coupling with any other business boundary.

Discussion is welcome.

## Usage

Set a ```<name>.Server``` project as startup project, F5 to debug, select Orders from the left menu.

- WebApp uses the DynamicComponent approach.
- WebApp2 uses the template approach.
- WebApp3 uses a monolithic approach.

All approaches use viewmodel composition to build a model from a single api call.

## DynamicComponent Approach

WebApp project makes use of 3 page components from the Sales service to demonstrate 3 different ways of resolving dynamic components from another service boundary and render them where the consuming boundary wants them to be rendered.

- ```/orders``` This page uses a Blazor DynamicComponent to render a blazor component from another service boundary (Catalog).  Whilst there's no compile-time dependency for this UI composition approach, there is knowledge leaking from the Catalog domain into the Sales domain as the fully qualified name and component parameter contract must be known to Sales UI components.
- ```/orders-name``` This page again use a ServiceDynamicComponent to render the same blazor component from the Catalog domain.  This branding component resolves the required type and parameters to pass to an encapsulated DynamicComponent by using a logical name to find the correct component to render.  A key is optional as some components might not require one.
- ```/orders-placement``` This page defines contracts to resolve components from other boundaries.  It's a less-coupled approach as the consuming boundary merely decides what the contract is for rendering at a place in the page, whilst the dependent boundary determines if they want to support that contract with a viable component.

### ServiceDynamicComponent explained

This component essentially obfuscates the dependent component type information so the consuming service boundary only needs to know the logical name of the component, e.g. "OrderProductInfo".  Some form of locical identifer is needed else determiniation of the component to render would be impossible.  We use a specific name here.

### Reversing the naming dependency

One other possible solution to determing the component to render is to have the consuming service boundary decide on names for where the component is placed, a placeholder name basically.  So rather than specifying the logical component name to resolve, the consumer is advertising the name of a placeholder.

The dependent service boundary then produces components that can be resolved to that placeholder.  This most likely requires some naming semantics to the placeholder name so as to avoid conflicts.

This would allow the consuming boundary the ability to publish to other domains that they can "plug-in" a component in the defined placeholder without necessarily knowing anything about what that component renders.  The previous approach almost gives away the intent of the component by its name alone (Order "Product Info").

This can work not just for card style layouts but also tables.  The latter would require 2 placeholder names and associated components to allow a dependent domain to render table headers as well as table cells.

## Template Approach

WebApp2 project does not use any dynamic component.  Instead, it makes the app responsible for the ```/orders``` page and how to construct the components it wants, starting with the Orders component from Sales.  This component is only responsible for the following:

1. building composition model state, 
2. making the composition model available for child components, and 
3. extracting keys from the model so that child components can index their data.

This approach also makes the responsibility of how to layout components solely with the app's page rather than any single service boundary.  As an example, 2 approaches are shown; one using a general card-style layout, and another using table layout.  The latter requires usage of service components that know how to render table headers and rows.

## Monolithic Approach

WebApp3 project uses a monolithic approach to the model returned from the viewmodel composition API call.  It combines each service's model into a single model owned by the web app itself and uses this model to render a list of orders using a single component also contained within the webapp.  No service-owned UI components are consumed in this webapp.

NOTE:  This example is provided as an example of how vertical slicing ends at the API layer.  Whilst this does couple services at the UI, it does offer advantages in terms of simpler development with hot reload provided by the toolset.  This may be preferable if a development team is small but may hinder team scaling in the future.
